# Empty project to follow the Django 4 official tutorial

Note: this project contains a `.gitignore` file, so that you will only share *source* code on GitHub. In particular it ignores:

- Compiled Python code (`.pyc` files)
- VS Code IDE stuff (`.vscode/` subdir)
- SQLite database content (`db.sqlite3` file)
- etc.

## Get your own local copy of this project

1. Fork this project:
   1. Click the "Fork" button in the-top right corner of this page
   2. Select your GitHub account; you will be landing in *your* project's GitHub page (`john-doe/awng-tutorial` instead of `EISC-209-AWNG/awng-tutorial`)
2. Add your teachers as members of ***your*** project:
   1. Go to Settings / Collaborators on your project's GitHub page
   2. Use Add Collaborator for each teacher (type its GitHub identifier)
3. Allow teachers to create issues in your project
   1. Go to Settings / General on your project's GitHub page
   2. Scroll down until you find the Features section, and enable the Issues feature
4. Rename your project so that it clearly identifies you: 
   1. Go to Settings/ General on your project's GitHub page
   2. Type the new Repository Name: `awng-tutorial-firstname-lastname`, with *your* name, e.g. `awng-tutorial-john-doe` 
   3. Click the "Rename" button

At this point, you have your own project on GitHub with an appropriate initial content. Next, you need to get a **working copy** on your computer:

1. Follow the instructions of the [*Cloning your forked repository*](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo#cloning-your-forked-repository) section of https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo
2. Launch VS Code and open the local directory, named `awng-tutorial-firstname-lastname`
3. In your local project directory, create a virtual environment and install Django (see next section)

## Install Django in a virtual environment

The following commands create a `venv` virtual environment in your local copy of the project. Open a terminal in your local directory (it can be VS Code integrated terminal), then:

### On Linux or macOS

```bash
$ cd /path/to/project
$ python -m venv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
(venv) $ pip install Django
```

### On Windows via Git Bash

```bash
$ cd /path/to/project
$ py -m venv venv
$ source venv/Scripts/activate
(venv) $ pip install Django
```

### On Windows via powershell

```powershell
$ cd \path\to\project
$ py -m venv venv
$ venv\Scripts\activate
(venv) $ pip install Django
```

Warning: `activate` might not work on Windows, complaining about some "execution policy" matter. In that case, open a powershell console, run `Set-ExecutionPolicy -scope CurrentUser` and answer `bypass`.

## Use the virtual environment afterwards

Every time you will use a *new* terminal/console to type python or Django commands, you will need to reactivate the virtual environment by calling the `activate` script. Actually, you need to run the `activate` script if you do not see `(venv)` before the shell prompt.

For instance, every time you restart VS Code to work on the project, you will have to go to the project local directory if needed, and then to activate `venv`:

```bash
$ cd /path/to/project
$ source venv/bin/activate
(venv) $ 
```

or on Windows via powershell in VS Code:

```powershell
$ cd \path\to\project
$ venv\Scripts\activate
(venv) $ 
```

or on Windows via Git Bash in VS Code:

```bash
$ cd /path/to/project
$ source venv/Scripts/activate
(venv) $ 
```
